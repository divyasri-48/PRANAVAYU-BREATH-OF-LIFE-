# PRANAVAYU-BREATH-OF-LIFE-
Pranavayu mans Life-Giving Air. The air we breath is totally polluted in metro-poilitian cities like mumbai,delhi etc.Carbon dioxide (\(CO_{2}\)) is a colorless, odorless, and non-flammable gas that is a fundamental component of Earth’s atmosphere and essential for life.
It is the primary carbon source for life on Earth, acting as a critical ingredient in photosynthesis and a key regulator of the planet's temperature through the natural greenhouse effect.
 I want to create new method that reduces carbon-dioxide in nature.  By burning waste in dump-yards it releases lots of carbon-dioxide  into nature.Carbon dioxide is natural, non-toxic gas 
 present in the  atmosphere ,but it is not a gas that human beings need to  take in for survival.Nature convertion of co2 to o2 primarily through photosynthesis and algae.
 "new method" would need to be a concentrated biological system (like an Algae-Reactor) or a chemical mimic of photosynthesis that works thousands of times faster than a standard tree
